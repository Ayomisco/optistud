{% for message in chat_history %}
  {% if message.user_input %}
    <p><strong>{{ message.user.username }}:</strong> {{ message.user_input }} <em>({{ message.timestamp|timesince }} ago)</em></p>
  {% endif %}
  {% if message.chatbot_response %}
    <p><strong>Chatbot:</strong> {{ message.chatbot_response }} <em>({{ message.timestamp|timesince }} ago)</em></p>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
This template will display the username of the user who sent each message, as well as the relative time that the message was sent using the timesince filter.

forms
If you want to use Django forms to handle user input in your chat application, you will need to create a form class to define the fields and behavior of the form. Here's an example of how you might do this:

Copy code
from django import forms

class ChatForm(forms.Form):
    user_input = forms.CharField(label='Message', max_length=1024)
This form has a single field, user_input, which is a text field with a maximum length of 1024 characters.

To use the form in your Django view, you will need to create an instance of the form and pass it to the template context. Here's an example of how you might update the chat_view view to use the ChatForm form:

Copy code
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Chat
from .forms import ChatForm
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def chat_view(request):
    form = ChatForm(request.POST or None)
    if request.method == 'POST' and form.is_valid():
        user_input = form.cleaned_data['user_input']
        chatbot_response = generate_response(user_input)
        Chat.objects.create(user=request.user, user_input=user_input, chatbot_response=chatbot_response)
    else:
        user_input = ''
        chatbot_response = ''

    chat_history = Chat.objects.all()
    context = {
        'form': form,
        'user_input': user_input,
        'chatbot_response': chatbot_response,
        'chat_history': chat_history,
    }
    return render(request, 'chat.html', context)

def generate_response(prompt):
    completions = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )

    message = completions.choices[0].text
    return message
This view creates an instance of the ChatForm form and passes it to the template context. It then checks if the form is valid when the user submits the form and, if it is, creates a new Chat object with the user's input and the chatbot's response.

To display the form in the template, you will need to update the template to render the form fields. Here's an example of how you might do this:

Copy code
<!-- chat.html -->

<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>

<hr>

{% for message in chat_history %}
  {% if message.user_input %}
    <p><strong>{{ message.user.username }}:</strong> {{ message.user_input }} <em>({{ message.timestamp|timesince }} ago)</em></p>
  {% endif %}
  {% if message.chatbot_response %}
    <p><strong>Chatbot:</strong>


urls
To create a URL pattern for the chat view in your Django application, you will need to import the path function from Django's urls module and the chat_view view from your app's views module. Here's an example of how you might do this:

Copy code
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('chat/', views.chat_view, name='chat_view'),
]
This will create a URL pattern that routes requests to the /chat/ URL to the chat_view view.

You can then include this URL pattern in the urlpatterns list of your main Django urls module. For example:

Copy code
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),
]
This will include the chat_view URL pattern in the main urlpatterns list, making it accessible to your Django application.

getting Page not found (404)
Request Method:	GET
Request URL:	http://127.0.0.1:8000/ai-chat/post?csrfmiddlewaretoken=46q2TW3lsSWkTdvpa6PXH102LlInCc68PnlTJItAxHu7rjNk4uLuNXgmg7QxzqyB
It looks like you are trying to access a URL with the path /ai-chat/post and are getting a "Page not found" error. This error usually indicates that there is no URL pattern in your Django application that matches the requested URL.

To fix this error, you will need to make sure that you have a URL pattern defined in your Django application that matches the requested URL.

For example, if you want to access the chat_view view at the /ai-chat/ URL, you will need to define a URL pattern like this:

Copy code
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('ai-chat/', views.chat_view, name='chat_view'),
]
This will route requests to the /ai-chat/ URL to the chat_view view.

You will also need to make sure that you have included this URL pattern in the urlpatterns list of your main Django urls module. For example:

Copy code
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),
]
This will include the chat_view URL pattern in the main urlpatterns list, making it accessible to your Django application.
